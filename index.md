## Welcome to signals23

This website is set up to test sending Pixel Events to Facebook. The following are some buttons that don't do anything other than send events to my test Business Account I've created on Facebook.

<button onclick="fbq('track', 'Subscribe');">Subscribe</button>

<button onclick="fbq('track', 'Purchase', {currency: "USD", value: 10.00});">Purchase $10</button>

<button onclick="fbq('track', 'Purchase', {currency: "USD", value: 200.00});">Purchase $200</button>

<button onclick="fbq('track', 'Purchase', {currency: "USD", value: 600.00});">Purchase $600</button>


### Jekyll Themes

Thank you to the Jekyll Theme on Github Pages for helping me get started easily with testing.
